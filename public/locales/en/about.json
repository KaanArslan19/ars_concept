  "description": "In 2022, we restored the father's house in our 7-acre garden and turned it into twin villas and entered the accommodation sector in 2023. We turned the place where our houses, named after tangerine and avocado species, are located into 1 acre, added portable houses and made it more secure with a 24/7 camera system. \nIn addition to 20 tangerine trees, 5 banana trees, 4 olive trees, 3 avocado trees, 2 lemon trees, 1 walnut tree, 1 priest plum tree, 1 angelika plum tree, 1 cherry tree, 1 pomegranate tree, 1 fig tree, 1 papaya tree and a small garden where we planted tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, zucchini in summer and winter vegetables in winter, this area was created for our guests to benefit during their stay. Ars concept houses offers you a holiday experience that you will remember with happiness with our concept that is designed in an intimate way and where all the details are considered for your comfort. \nSince the first day we started our service, we continue our journey in the sector with Turkish hospitality for the happiness and comfort of each of our guests. At Ars Concept Houses, where you will open your eyes to the sounds of birds every day, you can pick tomatoes and peppers for your breakfast in summer, or pick tangerines and squeeze juice in winter. You can go to the unique Gümüldür beach, which is 5 minutes away by car, and leave yourself in the clear waters. We also provide services for your celebrations, invitations and organizations."
